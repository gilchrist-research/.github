> **We build AI systems that find vulnerabilities before attackers do.**

### The Problem

DeFi protocols lost **$4B+** in 2024-2025. Traditional audits take weeks, cost $200K+, and miss economic exploits that only emerge at runtime. The industry needs autonomous, continuous security that thinks like an attacker.

### Our Approach

We combine static analysis engines (Slither, Semgrep, Mythril) with **AI reasoning** that understands DeFi economics: flash loan paths, oracle manipulation, MEV extraction, liquidation cascades, governance attacks. The scanner finds the code issues. **The AI finds the money.**
